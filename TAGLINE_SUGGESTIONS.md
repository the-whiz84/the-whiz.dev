Here are 5 tagline suggestions based on your HPC/Linux/Python background:

1. "Architecting Systems. Automating Workflows."
   (Professional, highlights DevOps & Efficiency)

2. "Powering Infrastructure with Python & Linux."
   (Clear, literal, tool-focused)

3. "Engineering Reliability from the Command Line."
   (Retains the 'terminal' vibe but emphasizes stability/engineering)

4. "Optimizing Performance at Scale."
   (Direct nod to High Performance Computing role)

5. "Bridging Hardware, Code, and Cloud."
   (Comprehensive: Hardware background + Coding + Cloud integrations)

Let me know which one you prefer, and I will update the Hero section!
