# The-Whiz.dev — Kinetic Edition ⚡

This is the source code for the **Kinetic Edition** of my personal portfolio website, [the-whiz.dev](https://the-whiz.dev). This version emphasizes speed, bold typography, and impactful motion, reflecting a modern, high-performance aesthetic.

## ✨ Design Philosophy — "Kinetic Impact"

The Kinetic Edition is built to make a bold statement. Key design features include:
- **Typography-First Approach**: USing custom font pairings like **Monument Extended** and **Clash Display** for a high-end, editorial feel.
- **High-Contrast Palette**: Deep obsidian backgrounds contrasted with vibrant **Orange-500** accents.
- **Motion-Driven UX**: Utilizing **Framer Motion** for speed-inspired transitions, entrance animations, and section-tracking navigation.
- **Glassmorphic Navigation**: A sophisticated full-screen mobile overlay and a dynamic, blur-heavy desktop navbar.
